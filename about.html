Hello, my name is Jingyuan Zhu. I'm a Ph.D Candidate at Computer Science Engineering at University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~harshavm/). 
My research interest is in Network Systems. 
Specifically, my research focuses on studying & characterization of broken links on the web, and deriving solutions for dealing with broken links with the leverage of web archives. 
Up to now, I've looked into the reason for broken references on Wikipedia, helped design a new web archive that saves storage and preserves better fidelity, 
and implemented a system that automatically finds new URLs for the same pages whose original URLs no longer resolve.

Before studying as a Ph.D in Michigan, I received BSE from UM in CS in a dual degree with BSE from Shanghai JiaoTong University in ECE
