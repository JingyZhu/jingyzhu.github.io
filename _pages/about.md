Hello, my name is Jingyuan Zhu. I'm a Ph.D Candidate at Computer Science Engineering at University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Madhyastha/Harsha). 
My research interest is in Network Systems. 
Specifically, my research focuses on studying & characterization of broken links on the web, and deriving solutions for dealing with broken links with the leverage of web archives. 
Up to now, I've looked into the reason for [broken references on Wikipedia](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517745.3561451), helped design a [new web archive](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/goel) that saves storage and preserves better fidelity, 
and implemented a [system](https://webresearch.eecs.umich.edu/fable/) that automatically finds new URLs for the same pages whose original URLs no longer resolve.

Before studying as a Ph.D in Michigan, I received BSE from UM in CS in a dual degree with BSE from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) in ECE
