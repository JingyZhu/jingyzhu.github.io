I'm a Software Engineer in the Machine Learning Platform Infrastructure team at Apple AIML. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Michigan in October 2025, advised by [Prof. Harsha V. Madhyastha](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Madhyastha/Harsha). 
My research interests lie in the area of Web Systems. 
In my PhD, I focused on studying and deriving solutions for link rot on the modern web. 
I investigated the limitations of current approaches, built systems that automatically revive dead links and improve the fidelity of archived web pages, and developed techniques to optimize the trade-off between web-archival efficiency, fidelity, and storage overhead.

Before my PhD, I earned dual B.S.E. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Michigan and in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/).
